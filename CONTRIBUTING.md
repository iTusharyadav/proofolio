## Issue Assignment Rules (SWoC Mandatory)

This project strictly follows the SWoC Project Admin (PA) Playbook.

- A contributor can be assigned only ONE issue at a time
- Do NOT start working without being officially assigned

Meaningful progress includes:

## Issue Difficulty & Scoring (SWoC)

Each issue has exactly one SWoC difficulty tag:

Important notes:
- Difficulty is decided only by the Project Admin
- Points are awarded only after the PR is merged
- Issues without proper SWoC tags are not eligible for scoring
- Multiple difficulty tags on one issue are not allowed
